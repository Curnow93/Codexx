<p>Ever since my teenage years I have been interested in computers, learning everything I could about them, joining various communities around the internet to improve myself with them, I had met many people on the way but had other interests that would stop me from pursuing a career in web development, I had always known that I was great with computers but when young would be put off by the idea of being seen as a "nerd", after 4 years of college and unsuccesful applications to get a start as an electrical engineer...</p>

<p>My life became depressing and I was starting to lose hope, becoming angered by the reality not meeting my expectations and being told that I would need "experience" as if I hadn't tried to find it, I knew I was not the average person and was capable of better things, being told "no" all the time made me want to go onto better things, I was doubted at something I wasn't made for, but knew deep down my passion lied with computers rather than electrics, I slowly moved on from applying to electricians and electrical engineers to start learning as a web developer.</p>

<p>A year later I had discovered codeschool as I was missing parts previously learnt when young, at the time I would do it as a hobby, this time I would learn more than just a basics as I knew I would need to know more than what I did to become a professional web developer. My skills started to go from hobbyist to full time web developer sticking to it around 7 hours a day, but when you enjoy it, that's not so hard.</p>

<p>My advice to all those that are walking down the path that i've walked... Continue to spend countless hours learning in theory, then when you feel comfortable move on to coding, only then will you find confidence that you can do, rather than you know, when you have built things you will find gain motivation that you can build even better, don't work yourself up applying for countless amounts of jobs over and over again, focus on what you enjoy and become an expert, and find a guide along the way.</p>
